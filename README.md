As i progress with Power Bi, I collected a dataset from kaggle and i did analysis on it.  i was able to drive key insight on it, such as Number of Student, Total number of Sex, Number of sibling, Accommodation 
From the analysis i can derived the following observations and recommendation;



Observation

Scholarship Distribution:

The graph showing the "Sum of Scholarship Type Per Accommodation Type in Cyprus" indicates that students in dormitories receive the highest scholarships (4400), followed by rentals (3000) and those living with family (1875). This suggests that on-campus living may be incentivized through financial support.

Gender Distribution:

The pie chart for "Number of Students by Sex" reveals a higher percentage of female students (60%) compared to male students (40%). This gender disparity may warrant further investigation into enrollment strategies and support services tailored to each demographic.

Transportation Impact:

The bar chart titled "Impact of Projects Per Transportation to the University" shows that bus transportation is the most utilized (3 projects), followed by private transport (3) and other means (2). This indicates a need for reliable bus services, as they are crucial for student access.

Sibling Influence on Performance:

The "Sum of Number of Siblings/Student Grade" chart shows a correlation between the number of siblings and academic performance, with the highest grades (DD) associated with students having more siblings. This could suggest that family dynamics play a role in academic success.

Scholarship Type by Sex:

The "Sum of Scholarship Type by Sex" indicates that male students receive more scholarship funds (5300) compared to female students (4025). This disparity may require a review of scholarship allocation policies to ensure equitable support.

Overall Performance Metrics:

The total number of students (145) and the total salary available (236) provide a snapshot of the college's financial resources and student body size. The total number of siblings (407) and expected CGPA (395) can help in understanding the academic environment and expectations.


Recommendations:

Enhance Support for Female Students:

Given the lower scholarship amounts for female students, consider implementing targeted scholarship programs or mentorship initiatives to encourage female enrollment and retention.

Transportation Improvements:

Since bus transportation is heavily relied upon, investing in more efficient and frequent bus services could improve student attendance and satisfaction.

Family Dynamics Research:

Conduct further research into how family size and dynamics affect academic performance. This could lead to tailored support programs for students from larger families.

Equitable Scholarship Distribution:

Review and adjust scholarship distribution policies to ensure that all students, regardless of gender, have equal access to financial support.

Promote On-Campus Living:

Given the higher scholarship amounts for students living in dormitories, promote on-campus living as a viable option for new students, possibly through informational sessions or incentives.

Data-Driven Decision Making:

Utilize the insights from this dashboard to inform strategic planning and resource allocation, ensuring that decisions are based on comprehensive data analysis.
